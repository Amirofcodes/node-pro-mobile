# NODE-PRO Mobile Project Documentation

## Project Overview

NODE-PRO Mobile is an extension of the original NODE-PRO web application, designed to provide a mobile interface for managing articles and users. The project combines a React Native frontend with a Node.js backend, utilizing a microservices architecture and real-time WebSocket communication.

## Current Project State

### Backend Development

1. **Server Setup**:
   - Implemented Express.js server with proper middleware configuration.
   - Integrated WebSocket for real-time updates.
   - Implemented CORS handling for cross-origin requests.

2. **Database Connection**:
   - Set up MongoDB connection with error handling and logging.
   - Implemented connection pooling for improved performance.

3. **Authentication**:
   - Implemented JWT-based authentication.
   - Created routes for user registration and login.
   - Developed middleware for protecting routes.

4. **Article Management**:
   - Implemented CRUD operations for articles.
   - Added search functionality for articles.
   - Integrated image upload and processing for articles.

5. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Implemented WebSocket server for real-time communication.
   - Set up broadcasting for article updates, creations, and deletions.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the backend.
   - Added logging for important operations and errors.

### Frontend Web Development

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Organized frontend code into modular components.
   - Implemented proper separation of concerns (auth, articles, UI).

2. **Authentication**:
   - Developed login and registration functionality.
   - Implemented token-based authentication with local storage.

3. **Article Management**:
   - Created interfaces for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting articles.
   - Implemented image upload and display for articles.

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Developed a search interface for finding articles by code.

5. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Integrated WebSocket client for receiving real-time updates.

6. **UI/UX**:
   - Implemented responsive design for various screen sizes.
   - Created intuitive navigation between different sections of the app.

### Code Refactoring and Optimization

1. **Backend**:
   - Refactored routes for improved modularity.
   - Optimized database queries for better performance.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Reorganized JavaScript files for better maintainability.
   - Implemented error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

## Next Steps

1. **React Native Mobile Frontend**:
   - Set up React Native project structure.
   - Implement authentication screens (login, register).
   - Develop article management screens (list, detail, create, edit).
   - Integrate with backend API.
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSocket.

2. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Implement data validation and sanitization.
   - Enhance error handling and logging.
   - Optimize database queries and indexes.

3. **Testing**:
   - Develop unit tests for backend services.
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints.
   - Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation.
   - Create user guide for web and mobile applications.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline.
   - Prepare staging and production environments.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, WebSocket
- **Frontend Web**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Frontend Mobile**: React Native (upcoming)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **File Upload**: Multer, Sharp for image processing
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket (ws library)

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST `/api/auth/register`: Register a new user
- POST `/api/auth/login`: Login user

### Articles
- GET `/api/articles`: Fetch all articles
- GET `/api/articles/:id`: Fetch a specific article
- POST `/api/articles`: Create a new article
- PUT `/api/articles/:id`: Update an existing article
- DELETE `/api/articles/:id`: Delete an article
- GET `/api/articles/:id/image`: Fetch article image
- GET `/api/articles/search/:codeArticle`: Search for an article by code

## WebSocket Events

- `newArticle`: Broadcast when a new article is created
- `updateArticle`: Broadcast when an article is updated
- `deleteArticle`: Broadcast when an article is deleted

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Implementing real-time updates
   **Solution**: Utilized WebSocket for efficient, real-time bidirectional communication

2. **Challenge**: Handling image uploads
   **Solution**: Implemented Multer for file upload handling and Sharp for image processing

3. **Challenge**: Ensuring secure authentication
   **Solution**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with proper token management

## Future Improvements

1. Implement offline mode for mobile application
2. Enhance search functionality with filters and sorting options
3. Implement user roles and permissions
4. Add analytics and reporting features
5. Optimize performance for large datasets

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the NODE-PRO Mobile project, detailing the progress made in both backend and frontend development, and outlining the next steps for implementing the React Native mobile frontend.
