## 1. Project Overview

NODE-PRO Mobile is a comprehensive article and inventory management system with both web and mobile interfaces. It's designed to provide real-time updates, secure authentication, efficient CRUD operations on articles, and now includes an AI-powered article creation feature and a Price Guessing Game.

### Key Features:

- User authentication
- Article management (CRUD operations)
- AI-powered article creation
- Real-time updates
- Image upload and processing
- Search functionality
- Responsive web interface
- Native mobile app with dark mode support
- Price Guessing Game

## 2. System Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **Backend Service**: Node.js with Express.js
2. **Database**: MongoDB
3. **Web Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript
4. **Mobile Frontend**: React Native with Expo
5. **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server
6. **AI Service**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT model for article analysis

## 3. Backend Design

(No changes to this section)

## 4. Web Frontend Design

(No changes to this section)

## 5. Mobile Frontend Design

### Technology Stack:

- React Native
- Expo
- React Navigation
- Axios for API calls
- Expo SecureStore for token storage
- Expo ImagePicker for image selection
- AsyncStorage for local data storage
- OpenAI API for AI-powered article creation

### Key Features:

1. **Native UI Components**: Utilizes React Native's core components
2. **Navigation**: Tab-based and stack navigation
3. **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
4. **Dark Mode**: Theme switching capability
5. **Image Picker**: Integration with device camera and gallery
6. **AI-Powered Article Creation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT model to analyze images and generate article details
7. **Price Guessing Game**: Locally implemented game using stored article data

### Design Patterns:

1. **Presentational and Container Components**: Separates logic from UI
2. **Higher-Order Components**: For shared functionality (e.g., authentication checks)
3. **Render Props**: For component composition and logic sharing
4. **Custom Hooks**: For reusable logic, such as AI processing and theme management

## 6. Database Schema

## 11. AI-Powered Article Creation

(No changes to this section)

## 12. Price Guessing Game

1. **Game Logic**: Implemented entirely on the frontend using locally stored article data
2. **Data Source**: Uses articles stored in AsyncStorage, which are synced with the backend during the article list fetch
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Randomly selects an article from the local storage
   - Displays article details (excluding price) to the user
   - User submits a guess for the article's price
   - Game calculates the difference between the guess and actual price
   - Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the guess
4. **UI**: Integrated into the main navigation, accessible from the home screen
5. **State Management**: Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state management

## 13. Performance Considerations

(Add the following point to the existing list)

7. **Local Data Usage**: The Price Guessing Game uses locally stored data to reduce API calls and improve responsiveness

## 14. Testing Strategy

(Add the following point to the existing list)

6. **Game Logic Testing**: Implement unit tests for the Price Guessing Game logic to ensure correct point calculation and random article selection

## 15. Deployment Guidelines

(No changes to this section)

## 16. Future Enhancements

1. Implement user roles and permissions
2. Add data analytics and reporting features
3. Integrate barcode scanning in the mobile app
4. Implement offline mode with data synchronization
5. Add push notifications for important updates
6. Implement a more robust state management solution (e.g., Redux) if the app complexity increases
7. Enhance AI-powered article creation with more detailed analysis and category suggestions
8. Implement multi-language support for AI-generated content
9. Expand the Price Guessing Game with leaderboards and multiplayer functionality
10. Integrate social sharing features for game results

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the NODE-PRO Mobile project's technical aspects, including the new AI-powered article creation feature and the Price Guessing Game. It serves as a guide for developers working on the project and can be updated as the project evolves.
