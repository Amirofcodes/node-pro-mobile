   - Implemented lazy loading for improved performance.

## Next Steps

1. **React Native Mobile Frontend**:
   - Complete implementation of all article management screens.
   - Enhance UI/UX with custom components and animations.
   - Implement offline mode and data synchronization.

2. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Implement data validation and sanitization.
   - Enhance error handling and logging.
   - Optimize database queries and indexes.

3. **Testing**:
   - Develop unit tests for backend services.
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints.
   - Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows in both web and mobile frontends.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation.
   - Create user guide for web and mobile applications.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for both backend and mobile app.
   - Prepare staging and production environments.
   - Implement automated build and release process for the mobile app.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, WebSocket
- **Frontend Web**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Frontend Mobile**: React Native with Expo
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **File Upload**: Multer, Sharp for image processing
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket (ws library)
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Navigation**: React Navigation

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST `/api/auth/register`: Register a new user
- POST `/api/auth/login`: Login user

### Articles
- GET `/api/articles`: Fetch all articles
- GET `/api/articles/:id`: Fetch a specific article
- POST `/api/articles`: Create a new article
- PUT `/api/articles/:id`: Update an existing article
- DELETE `/api/articles/:id`: Delete an article
- GET `/api/articles/:id/image`: Fetch article image
- GET `/api/articles/search/:codeArticle`: Search for an article by code

## WebSocket Events

- `newArticle`: Broadcast when a new article is created
- `updateArticle`: Broadcast when an article is updated
- `deleteArticle`: Broadcast when an article is deleted
