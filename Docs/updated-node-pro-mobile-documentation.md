# NODE-PRO Project Documentation

## Project Overview

NODE-PRO is a comprehensive application for managing articles and inventory. It consists of a Node.js backend and two frontend applications: a web interface built with vanilla JavaScript, and a mobile app developed using React Native. The project utilizes a microservices architecture and implements real-time updates via WebSockets for seamless synchronization across platforms.

## Current Project State

2. **Database Connection**:

   - Set up MongoDB connection with error handling and logging.
   - Implemented connection pooling for improved performance.

3. **Authentication**:

   - Implemented JWT-based authentication.
   - Created routes for user registration and login.
   - Developed middleware for protecting routes.

4. **Article Management**:

   - Implemented CRUD operations for articles.
   - Added search functionality for articles.
   - Integrated image upload and processing for articles.

5. **Real-time Updates**:

   - Implemented WebSocket server for real-time communication.
   - Set up broadcasting for article updates, creations, and deletions.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the backend.
   - Added logging for important operations and errors.

### Web Frontend Development

6. **UI/UX**:
   - Implemented responsive design using CSS.
   - Created intuitive navigation between different sections of the app.

### Mobile Frontend Development

1. **Project Structure**:

   - Organized frontend code into modular components.
   - Implemented proper separation of concerns (auth, articles, UI).

2. **Authentication**:

   - Developed login functionality.
   - Implemented user registration feature.
   - Created separate screens for Login and Register.
   - Implemented token-based authentication with secure storage.

3. **Article Management**:

   - Created interfaces for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting articles.
   - Implemented image upload and display for articles.

4. **Search Functionality**:

   - Developed a search interface for finding articles by code.

5. **Real-time Updates**:

   - Integrated WebSocket client for receiving real-time updates.

6. **UI/UX**:

   - Implemented responsive design for various screen sizes.
   - Created intuitive navigation between different sections of the app using React Navigation.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
   - Added detailed logging for debugging purposes.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- POST `/api/auth/register`: Register a new user
- POST `/api/auth/login`: Login user

### Articles

- GET `/api/articles`: Fetch all articles
- GET `/api/articles/:id`: Fetch a specific article
- POST `/api/articles`: Create a new article
- PUT `/api/articles/:id`: Update an existing article
- DELETE `/api/articles/:id`: Delete an article
- GET `/api/articles/:id/image`: Fetch article image
- GET `/api/articles/search/:codeArticle`: Search for an article by code

## WebSocket Events

- `newArticle`: Broadcast when a new article is created
- `updateArticle`: Broadcast when an article is updated
- `deleteArticle`: Broadcast when an article is deleted

## Recent Updates

1. Implemented user registration feature in both web and mobile frontends.
2. Added real-time update functionality across all platforms.
3. Enhanced error handling and added more detailed logging for authentication processes.
4. Improved responsive design for the web frontend.
5. Optimized mobile app performance and UI/UX.

## Next Steps

1. Implement offline support for the mobile application.
2. Add unit and integration tests for backend, web frontend, and mobile frontend.
3. Implement a caching layer to improve performance across all platforms.
4. Strengthen security measures, including rate limiting and input validation.
5. Develop a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment of all components.
6. Enhance cross-platform data synchronization mechanisms.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the NODE-PRO project, detailing the progress made in backend, web frontend, and mobile frontend development. It outlines the recent updates and suggests future directions for the project.
